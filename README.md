=====
A proof-of-concept for a new [Dogescript](https://dogescript.io) transpiler.

Currently supports:
 - Variable declaration (`very`)
 - Function declaration (`such`)
 - Function calls (`plz`, `dose`)
 - Constructor calls (`new`)
 - Basic imports (`so`)
 - Basic conditionals (`rly`, `but`, `notrly`, but no comparisons yet)
 - Some other stuff (`trained`, `maybe`)

Limitations:
 - This parser does not parse everything, so whitespace and comments are not preserved in the output
 - Not everything is implemented yet :P
 - Probably other things
