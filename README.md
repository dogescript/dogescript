## dogescript [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dogescript.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/dogescript)

(aka when Zach went insane)

This is an implementation of the best new compile-to-JS language, dogescript. Wow. 

And yes, I am very aware I went about a very, er, *non-conventional*, way of parsing a language, and is probably riddled with bugs and edge-cases. However, this is dogescript, so anything goes!

```
    wow
         such dogescript
     very compiled
                  next-generation
       npm wow
```


### Installation

`npm install -g dogescript`

### Usage

Dogescript pipes to sdout. To compile a dogescript file:

`dogescript location/to/dogescript.djs --beautify`

Add the `--beautify` option if you want properly formatted JS.

### Language

I may document this properly soon, but for now see `example.djs` or look through the code. Dogescript accepts regular JS as well.
